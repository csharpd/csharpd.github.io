In Jan ‘13 [I made a promise](http://www.eyedea.org.uk/2012/12/28/the-year-ahead/). I was determined to aquire some technical nous. Developers had been making me jealous. I wanted their magic ability to turn ideas into reality overnight. Over the course of that I year I completed [Code First Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/), built a number of [websites](http://www.geekchic.me/) and launched an [iOS app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52XkpGwWxLo).

Now I've I’ve decided to go the whole hog and devote 84 days to learning to code.  Next month I'm starting at Makers Academy, an intensive Ruby web development bootcamp.
I've finished the prep material so I asked one of the MA teachers what else I could do to prepare. His answer surprised me:
>’Work on your mindset. The biggest thing that people struggle with here is themselves. If you can treat it like a game and remain positive, you will do well”.

The same day I came across a TED talk that also talks about how positivity enhances your ability to learn new things!
>"Your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed… When you are positive your brain is flooded with dopamine and this turns on learning centres in your brain. You become more intelligent, more creative, you have more energy ,you are faster and more accurate"

Apparently you can train yourself to become more optimistic which will cause get your brain to work more effectively. In his TED talk Shawn Achor suggests the following;

1. ###Create a gratitude list and add to it each day
*This teaches your brain to scan the world for the positive first.*

2. ###Journal a positive experience that happened to you at the end of every day
*Doing that will cause your brain to relive it.*

3. ###Exercise
*Endorphins*

4. ###Meditate
*This practise teaches how to focus singularly on the task at hand (and reduces the likelihood  of being distracted by unhelpful thoughts).*

5. ###Perform a weekly random act of kindness
*You can cause "ripples of positivity” to spread through the environment around you.*
