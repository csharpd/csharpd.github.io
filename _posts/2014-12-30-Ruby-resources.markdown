Six months ago I decided to teach myself Ruby.

Now I work as a developer :)

These are the resources that I found helpful when I was starting out:

If your aim is to quickly find out what 'coding' is, spend an hour with [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/). This is a super easy (& fun) way to test the waters.
Then try and make your own site. This was my [first attempt](http://www.geekchic.me/).

After that pick a language. I plumped for Ruby because it is touted as beginner friendly and used [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby) to get used to the syntax (how to write).

A Note on Practice and Persistence (from Zed A. Shaw)
>While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs, and anything else I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day.

With this in mind, I spent a few weeks last spring reading Chris Pine's 'Learn to program' and coding on the bus to and from work. You can get the book for free [here](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html). It's really worth doing the exercises that he outlines. After that I worked my way through [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html). Don't be put off by the name - it's not that hard.

What is hard?

Learning to code *alone*. That's hard.

Coding is a perishible skill and learning in a piecemeal, unsystematic way after work / at weekends can at times be slow, painful & lonely. As a beginner tiny errors easily mess up your programs and your progression. Missing semicolons pose a genuine threat to your development.
I believe that the best way to get around this is to do an in-person course to at least get your head around the basics. Then move on to developing projects collaboratively with people of a similar level.

[Code First Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/)  introduced me to HTML, CSS, Sinatra & Ruby. This is an amazing (free) part time course for women at or just out of university. If you can get a spot jump at the chance - I can't recommend it enough.

To prepare for Makers Academy I did :

+ this [Unix tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)

+ this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/)

+ this [Intro to Git](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html)

+ & worked on my [mindset](http://csharpd.github.io/education/2014/05/01/The-happiness-advantage.html).

Hope that helps. [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/chloe_does) what you make!
