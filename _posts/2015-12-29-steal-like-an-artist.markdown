*Things no one told you about being creative...*
### Steal
> "One of the surest of tests is the way in which a poet borrows. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest."

T S Eliot

>"What is originality? Undetected plagiarism"

William Ralph inge

###We are shaped and fashioned by what we love
<br>
>You are in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let in to your life. You are the sum of your influences.

Goethe


###Education
<br>
"Whether your in school or not, it's always your job to get yourself an education." 
>"Whether I went to school or not, I would always study" 

RZA

##Copying

>"Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find yourself"

Yohji Yamamoto

"Copying is about reverse engineering. It's like a mechanic taking apart a car to see how it works.
Imitation is about copying. Emulation is when imitation goes one step further, breaking through into your own thing.
Kobe Bryant (basket ball) stole a lot of his moves but realised he couldn't completely pull them off because he doesn't have the same body type.
He had to adapt the moves to make them his own."

##Write the story you want to read
"Write the kind of story that you like best. The same principle applies to your life and career. 
Whenever you are at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, "What would make a better story?".
Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, 
build the products you want to use - do the work you want to see done."

>"We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops."

John Cleese

##Work that only comes from the head isn't any good.
"You don't need a scientific study to tell you that sitting in front of a computer all day is killing you, and killing your work.
We need to move to feel like we're making something with our bodies, not just our heads." 

##Computers
"Computers are really good for editing your ideas, and for getting ideas ready to be published out into the world, but there are not good for generating ideas.
There are too many opportunities to hit the delete key. The computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us - we start editing ideas before we have them."

##Procrastination
>The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.

Jessica Hische

##Hobbies
"It's so important to have a hobby. A hobby is something creative that is just for you. You don't try to make money or get famous off it, you just do it because it makes you happy.
Music is only for me and my friends. We get together every Sunday and make noise for a couple of hours. 
No pressure, no plans. It's regenerative. It's like church."

##Attention
"You want attention only after you're doing really good work. There's no pressure when you are unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things for the fun of it. When you are unkown there is nothing to distract you from getting better. 
No public image to manage. No huge pay check on the line. No stockholders. No emails from your agent. Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it."

##Becoming known
"Do good work and share it with people. The more open you are about sharing your passions, the close people will feel to your work.
Bob Ross taught people how to paint. He gave his secrets away. Martha Stewart teaches you how to make your house and life awesome.
She gives her secrets away. People love it when you give your secrets away."

##Home
"It helps to live around interesting people, and not necessarily people who do what you do. 
You have to find a place that feeds you - creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally."

##Learning
"Stand next to the talent. Garbage in, garbage out. 
You are only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with.
Hang out with him. Try to be helpful."

>"The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from"

QuestLove

##Fanletters
"Show your appreciation without expecting anything in return."

##Validation is for parking
"The trick is to be too busy doing work to care."

##Be boring
>Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.

Gustave Flaubert

##Money
"The art of holding on to money is all about saying no to consumer culture. Saying no to takeout, $4 lattes and a shiny new computer when the old one still works fine."

##Keep your day job
"A day job gives you money, a connection to the world, and a routine. Freedom from financial stress also means freedom in your art.
A day job puts you in the path of other human beings. Learn from them, steal from them. I've tried to take day jobs where I can learn things that I can use in my work."

>"If you don't take money they can't tell you what to do"

Bill Cunningham

"The worst thing that a day job does is take away time from you but it makes up for that by giving you a daily routine in which you can schedule regular time for your creative pursuits.
**Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time**
Work gets done in the time available.
The trick is to find a day job that pays decently, doesn't make you want to vomit, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time."

##**Do work everyday no matter what** 
"Amassing a body of work or building a career is a lot about the slow accumulation of little bits of effort over time."

> If you ask yourself, ‘What’s the best thing that happened today?’ it actually forces a certain kind of cheerful retrospection that pulls up from the recent past things to write about that you wouldn’t otherwise think about. If you ask yourself, 'What happened today?’ it’s very likely that you’re going to remember the worst thing, because you’ve had to deal with it–you’ve had to rush somewhere or somebody said something mean to you–that’s what you’re going to remember. But if you ask what the best thing is, it’s going to be some particular slant of light, or some wonderful expression somebody had, or some particularly delicious salad. I mean, you never know… 

Nicholson Baker

##Marry well
"Who you marry is the most important decision you'll ever make. And "marry well" doesn't just mean your life partner - it also means who you do business with, who you befriend, who you choose to be around."

##Leave it out
"In this age of information abundance and overload, those who will get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so that they can concentrate on what's really important to them.
Nothing is more paralysing that the idea of limitless possibilities. The idea that you can do anything is absolutely terrifying.
The way to get over a creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom.
Write a song in your lunch break. Paint a picture with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iphone and a few of your friends.
**Don't make excuses for not working - make things with the time, space and materials you have, right now.**

It's often what an artist chooses to leave out that makes the art interesting. 
What isn't shown versus what is. **It's the same for people: What makes us interesting isn't just what we have experienced, but also what we haven't experienced.** 
The same is true when you do your work: You must embrace your limitations and keep moving."

>"Telling yourself you have all the time in the world, all the money in the world, all the colors in the palate, anything you want - that just kills creativity"

Jack White

"**Start now**"
