"The sun never knew how wonderful it was" the architect Louis Kahn said "until it fell on the wall of a building" 
<br>
<br>
"It comes with the thrill of a slap for us then to hear praise of shadows and darkness; so it is when it comes to us the excitement of realising that musicians everywhere make their music to capture silence or that architects develop complex shapes just to envelop space."
<br>
"The Japanese toilet is truly a place of spiritual repose... No words can describe the sensation as one sits in the dim light, basking in the faint glow reflected from the shoji, lost in meditation or gazing out into the garden.
As i have said there are certain prerequisites: a degree of dimness, absolute cleanliness and quiet so complete that one can hear the hum of a mosquito. I love to listen from such a toilet to the sound of softly falling rain... "
<br>
<br>
"But it is on occasions such as this that I always think how different everything would be if we in the Orient had developed our own science. Suppose for instance that we had developed our own physics and chemistry: would not the technique and industries based on them have taken on a different form, would not our myriads of everyday gadgets, our medicines, the products of our industrial art - would they not have suited our national temper better than they do?"
<br>
<br>
"As a general matter we find it really hard to be at home with things that shine and glitter" 
"Of course this 'sheen of antiquity' of which we hear so much is in fact the glow of grime. In both Chinese and Japanese the words denoting this glow describe a polish that comes of being touched over and over again, a sheen produced by the oils that naturally permeate an object over long years of handling - which is to say grime. If 'elegance is frigid' , it can as well be described as filthy... Yet for better of for worse we do love the things that bear the marks of grime, soot, and weather, and we love the colors and the sheen that call to mind the past that made them."
<br>
<br>
"A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty however, must always grow with the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in the shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends."
<br>
<br>
"To me this is the very epitome of reality, for a woman of the past did indeed exist only from the collar up and the sleeves out; the rest of her remained hidden in darkness."
<br>
<br>
"Our ancestors made of a woman an object inseparable from darkness, like lacquerware decorated in gold or mother-of-pearl. They hid as much of her as they could in the shadows, concealing her arms and legs in the folds of long sleeves and skirts, so that one part and one only stood out – her face."
<br>
<br>
"Why should this propensity to seek beauty in darkness be so strong only in Orientals?...But what produces such differences in taste? In my opinion it is this: we Orientals tend to seek our satisfactions in whatever surroundings we happen to find ourselves, to content ourselves with things as they are; and so darkness causes us no discontent, we resign ourselves to it as inevitable. If light is scarce then light is scarce; we will immerse ourselves in the darkness and there discover its own particular beauty. But the progressive Westerner is determined always to better his lot. From candle to oil lamp, oil lamp to gaslight, gaslight to electric light—his quest for a brighter light never ceases, he spares no pains to eradicate even the minutest shadow. "
<br>
<br>
"The elegant aristocrat of old was immersed in this suspension of ashen particles, soaked in it, but the man of today, long used to the electric light, has forgotten that such a darkness existed...This was the darkness in which ghosts and monsters were active, and indeed was not the women who lived in it, behind thick curtains, behind layer after layer of screens and doors - was she not of a kind with them? The darkness wrapped her around tenfold, twentyfold, it filler the collar, teh sleeves of her kimono, the folds of her skirt, wherever a hollow invited. Further yet: might it not have been the reverse, might no the darkness have emerged from her mouth and those black teeth, from the black of her hair, like the thread from the great earth spider?
  
AFTERWORD
"In praise of shadows is an essay on aesthetics by an eminent Japanese novelist; but to sum it up as such is as likely to mislead as to enlighten, for in this case neither novelist or essay nor aesthetic fits very neatly within the usual boundaries of these terms".
<br>
<br>
"A well-stocked mind, perhaps, but a vagrant mind" a critical reader might answer. And there is no denying that Tanizaki does wander - from architecture to toilets to jade to women to food - often with only the most tenuous of transitions, and quite as often turning back to repeat himself. To the western reader trained to expect symmetry and logical progression in an essay, the urge to edit Tanizaki is at times almost irresistible. He has the perverse habit of shifting without warning from a tone of high seriousness to something near facetiousness; as when he recommends the toilet as a major source of poetic inspiration. His descriptions of lacquerware under candlelight and women in the darkness of the house of pleasure are perfect jewels; but would they not stand out to better advantage removed from the company of that murmuring bowl of soup and Einstein's trip to Kyoto?
Yet to do so would drain the life of 'In Praise of Shadows', for Tanizaki's 'essay' works in ways different from the Western essay, and demands the freedom of his seemingly haphazard style."
<br>
<br>
"One of the oldest and most deeply ingrained of Japanese attitudes to literary style holds that too obvious a structure is contrivance, that too orderly an exposition falsifies the ruminations of the heart, that the truest representation of the searching mind is just to "follow the brush". Indeed it would not be far wrong to say the narrative technique that we call 'stream of consciousness' has an ancient history in Japanese letters. It is not that Japanese writers have been ignorant of the powers of conclusion and articulation. Rather they have felt that certain subjects - the vicissitudes of the emotions, the fleeting perceptions of the mind - are best couched in a style that conveys something of the uncertainty of the mental process and not just it's neatly packaged conclusions."
<br>
<br>
"Thus it was that the compilers of the great classical anthologies, perhaps the most painstakingly constructed compilations in the history of any literature, deliberately muted the sense of seasonal progression by frequent back-tracking, and insisted upon a background of quite ordinary poems to set off the truly stellar compositions. And thus it is that Tanizaki's subject requires the shadowy style in which he treats it. Questions of the sort he raises have no final answers, and the mind of the writer who takes them up must always be groping, his statements always tentative."
