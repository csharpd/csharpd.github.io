# Show your work - Austin Kleon

>For an artist the great problem to be solved is how to get one's self noticed

Honore De Balzac

#Together
"If you believe in the lone genius myth, creativity is an **antisocial** act, performed by only a few great figures - Mozart, Einstein, Picasso.
There is a healthier way to think about creativity. Great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals - artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers - who make up an "ecology of talent"."

#Amateur
> That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else.

Charlie Chaplin

"We are all terrified of being revealed as amateurs, but in fact, today it is the amateur - the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French, the word means "lover"), regardless of the potential for fame, money or career - who often has the advantage over the professional.
Because they have so little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. They take chances, experiment, and follow their whims."

>If you spend your life avoiding vulnerability, you and your work will never truly connect with other people.

Colin Marshall

#Learn out loud
"The best way to get started on the path of sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning in front of others. 
Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they are **not** sharing."

#Memento Mori
>"The sum of every obituary is how heroic people are, and how noble"
Maira Kalman

"Obituaries aren't really about death; they're about life. Reading about people who are now dead and did things with their lives makes me want to get up and do something with mine. Thinking about death every morning makes me want to live."
 
#Take people behind the scenes
"There's art work, the finished piece, framed and hung on a gallery wall and then there is art work - looking for inspiration, getting an idea, applying oil to canvas.
People really do want to see how sausages get made."

#Share something small everyday
>put yourself and you work, out there every day, and you'll start meeting some amazing people.

Bobby Solomon

"Building a substantial body of work takes a long time - a life time. So forget about decades, forget about years, and forget about months. Focus on days.

Once a day after you've done your day's work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. 
If you're in the very early stages, share your influences and what's inspiring you. Write about your methods. Show the final product.
If you have lots of projects out in the world - report on how they are doing - you can tell stories about how people are interacting with your work.
Once you make sharing part of your daily routine, you'll notice themes and trends emerging in what you share. You'll find patterns in your flow.
Stock is the durable stuff. It's the content you product that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. 
Stock is best made by collecting, organising and expanding upon your flow."

#Question
"What are you working on?"

#The 'so what' test
"The act of sharing is one of generosity - you're putting something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining to someone else."

#Build a good name
> Build a good name. Keep your name clean. Don't make compromises. Don't worry about making a bunch of money or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work ... and if you can build a good name, eventually that name will be it's own currency."

William Burroughs

>carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.

Andy Baio

"Don't think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Fill your website with your work and ideas and the stuff you care about."

#Don't be a hoarder
> The problem with hoarding is that you end up living of your reserves. Eventually you'll become stale. If you give away everything you have you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish ... Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.

Paul Arden

> The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.

Annie Dilard

"The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference material."

#Before we begin
> You're only as good as your record collection

DJ Spooky

"Before we are ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others.
Where do you get your inspiration? What do you read? What sites do you visit? Music? Movies? Art? Collections? What's inside your scrapbook? Who's done work you admire? Who do you steal ideas from? Who do you follow on line?

Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do - sometimes even more than your own work."

#Followers
"If you want followers, be someone worth following. *So many people waste time and energy trying to make connections instead of getting good at what they do.*
Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you'll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It's that simple."

>What you want is to follow and be followed by human beings who care about issues that you care about

Jeffrey Zeldman

#The Vampire Test
>"Whatever excites you, go do it. Whatever drains you, stop doing it"

Derek Sivers

#Don't quit your show
"You can't count on success; you can only leave open the possibility for it."

> Work is never finished, only abandoned.

Paul Valery

"Every career is full of ups and downs."

>If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.

Orson Wells

>You can't plan on anything; you can only go about you work every day without hope or despair.

Isak Dinesen

#Misc

"If you happened to be wealthy and educated and alive in 16th - and 17th - century Europe, it was fashionable to have a Wunderkammern, "a wonder chamber" or a "cabinet of curiosities" in your house - a room filled with rare and remarkable objects that served as a kind of external display of your thirst for knowledge of the world.
Inside a cabinet you might find books, skeletons, jewels, shells, art, plants, minerals, taxidermy specimens, stones, or any other exotic artefact."
These collections often juxtaposed both natural and human-made marvels, revealing a kind of mash up of handiwork by both God and human beings."

>'The cat sat on the mat' is not a story. 'The cat sat on the dog's mat' is a story.

John Le Carre
