It turns out that I’ve signed up for much more than a coding course. During the introduction today we were told to think of MA as habit building exercise:

>"Twelve weeks is both a very long time and a very short time. If you go on to have a career as a software developer then three months is nothing.
This isn’t even the beginning.

>At Makers you are packing your backpack with things that will help you on your journey as a software craftsman.
During these 12 weeks yes, you will be learning to code but really… this is an opportunity to work on yourself, to learn good habits.

>It’s not about how much you do or how fast you do it.
It’s about learning to do things right”

I think I'm going to like it here. It felt brilliant to be in the same room as 24 other crazies. The fact that they too are willing to spend the next three months venturing into the unknown provides significant comfort.
