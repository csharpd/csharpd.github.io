I often get asked about which resources I found helpful when I was first learning to code so here is a post on that.

If your aim is to quickly find out what 'coding' is, spend an hour with [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/). This is a super easy (& fun) way to test the waters.
Then try and make your own site. This was my [first attempt](http://www.geekchic.me/).

After that pick a language. I plumped for Ruby because it is touted as beginner friendly and used [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby) to get used to the syntax (how to write).

A Note on Practice and Persistence (from Zed A. Shaw)
>While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs, and anything else I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day.

With this in mind, I spent a few weeks last spring reading Chris Pine's 'Learn to program' and coding on the bus to and from work. You can get the book for free [here](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html). It's really worth doing the exercises that he outlines. After that I worked my way through [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html). Don't be put off by the name - it's not that hard.

What is hard?

Learning to code *alone*. That's hard.

Coding is a perishible skill and learning in a piecemeal, unsystematic way after work / at weekends can at times be slow, painful & lonely. As a beginner tiny errors easily mess up your programs and your progression. Missing semicolons pose a genuine threat to your development.
I believe that the best way to get around this is to do an in-person course to at least get your head around the basics. Then move on to developing projects collaboratively with people of a similar level.

[Code First Girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/)  introduced me to HTML, CSS, Sinatra & Ruby. This is an amazing (free) part time course for women at or just out of university. If you can get a spot jump at the chance - I can't recommend it enough.

To prepare for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) I did :

+ this [Unix tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/),

+ this [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/),

+ & this [Intro to Git](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html).

Whilst I was at [Makers](http://www.makersacademy.com/) I found '[The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657)' particularly helpful for getting to grips with the ins and outs of Ruby.

So there you go. That's how I got going. Now go forth & make things, then [tweet me](https://twitter.com/chloe_does) what you build!

*The title of this post is a misnomer. With developing the learning never really stops.
